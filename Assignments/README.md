# Assignments
- Total 3 assignments, one for each week. Should be handed in on Fridays before midnight.
- Solutions and next weeks assignments are posted on Sunday evenings.
- It's very important that all collaborators contribute (commit) to the assignment.
- Students can earn 5 extra points to their project grade by contributing to the Syllabus repository (make PR improvements) and/or **answer Github issues from fellow students.**
- Teachers will keep an eye on Github issues every night between 20-22, but we encourage students to try to help.
- All issues must be clearly stated with description, steps to reproduce and system specs.
- Extra points are also rewarded for extra features in your projects.
